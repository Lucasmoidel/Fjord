# What is Fjord?
 
Fjord is a 2D game/graphics engine being primarily developed by lucasmoidel and JStudios6118 in C++ and SDL2. This repository contains the base Fjord library and example game. At the time of writing, we have very little done.

# Why is Fjord?

Fjord has been created to present users with an easier way to create graphical programs and games. This is mostly just a fun project for us to test our skills as programmers. If you would like to add your own code or improve our code, feel free to create a pull request or issue. Help on this project would be greatly appreciated!

# Planned Additions

- Camera System
- Sprite Rendering
- Tilemap System
- Input Mapping
- Basic Physics
- Particle System
- Sounds
- Lighting System
- and more!!!

# What Comes After Fjord?

When we feel Fjord is finished, we plan on creating an graphical editor to improve the usability of our library. Much later, we will attempt to implement 3D graphics and physics. Our ultimate goal with this project is to recreate the Source Engine created by Valve and make our own Half-Life/Portal style game.
